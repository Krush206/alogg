- Find out what needs to be done in order to support different formats
  like 8/16 bits, signed/unsigned, endianness differences, etc. Tested
  on my machine (i686-pc-linux-gnu) but likely to fail on others. If you
  find an Ogg/Vorbis file that doesn't work, I'd like to hear about it.
  If the file is not too large (less than 200 KB), you can send it to
  me via email, otherwise make it available on a web site/FTP site and
  send me the URL where I can get it.

- Maybe offer more control for the encoding. On the other hand, this
  is supposed to be a simple and easy to use API, so if you want power,
  you might as well use libvorbis directly...

- Support different bistream formats in a single file

- Test URL streaming in a real environment (not local)
