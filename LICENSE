The alogg distribution is, in an attempt to be confusing, licensed
on the terms of three different licenses:

- The core (alogg.h, alogg.c) is LGPL-like
- The grabber plugin is giftware
- The examples are BSD-like

Here are the details:

The core library (alogg.h, alogg.c) is licensed under the terms of
a modified GNU Library (now known as Lesser) General Public License.
Its goal is to allow anyone to use it freely in open source and closed
soure programs alike while keeping the library free software and
able to reincorporate enhancements that other may want to contribute
back.
Here is the legalese blurb:

   The alogg library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
   modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
   License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
   version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   The alogg library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
   Lesser General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
   License along with the alogg Library; if not, write to the Free
   Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA
   02111-1307 USA.

   As a special exception, if you link this library statically with a
   program, you do not have to distribute the object files for this
   program.
   This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
   you would have to distribute the object files for this program.



The grabber plugin is very heavily based on the sample plugin from
Allegro, so I adopted the same license as Allegro for this part.
Here is, once again, the legalese blurb:

   Allegro and the alogg grabber plugin are gift-ware. They were created by
   a number of people working in cooperation, and are given to you freely as
   a gift. You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally hack them about
   in any way you like, and you do not have to give us anything in return.
   However, if you like these products you are encouraged to thank us by
   making a return gift to the Allegro/alogg community. This could be by
   writing an add-on package, providing a useful bug report, making an
   improvement to the library and/or the plugin, or perhaps just releasing
   the sources of your program so that other people can learn from them.
   If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, it 
   would be nice if you mentioned Allegro and alogg somewhere in the
   credits, but you are not required to do this. We trust you not to abuse
   our generosity.  


Lastly, the examples are licensed under a BSD-like license, in an attempt
to help people integrate alogg in their program more easily. This license
is the same as the examples found in libvorbis' distribution. Last time
you see a legalese blurb there:
