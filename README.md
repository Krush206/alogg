				 version 1.3.7



alogg is a library which makes it easier to use Ogg/Vorbis streams with
Allegro. It offers facilities to decode, stream, and encode Ogg/Vorbis
streams with thread support and experimental URL streaming, and integrates
those facilities with Allegro's datafile and sample loading routines.

 -- Dependencies

alogg requires the following:

  libogg-1.0rc3       (or newer, available at http://www.vorbis.com/)
  libvorbis-1.0rc3    (or newer, available at http://www.vorbis.com/)
  allegro-4.0.0       (or newer, available at http://alleg.sf.net/)

To compile with Tremor, a fixed point implementation of the Ogg/Vorbis
decoder, you also a copy of the Tremor library. Tremor can be found at
http://www.xiph.org/.

To compile with URL support, you also need libcurl 7.10 or newer. libcurl
is a library for transferring data specified with URL syntax, available at
http://curl.haxx.se/.
Note that URL streaming is experimental is not ready for production use yet.
In particular, I have not yet tried to stream off an Icecast server.

To compile with threaded streaming support, you also need pthreads. pthreads
is the most widely used library for thread support, and is supplied with
most operating systems. You can even get a version of pthreads for MS-DOS
and MS-Windows. For the latter, it can be found somewhere at
http://www.redhat.com.

For information on how to build alogg and use it in your programs, have a
look in the INSTALL file, or the alogg documentation.
